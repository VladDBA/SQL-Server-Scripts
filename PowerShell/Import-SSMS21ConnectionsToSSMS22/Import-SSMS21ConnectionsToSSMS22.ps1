.SYNOPSIS
    Dynamically locate the SSMS version folders whose sdk.txt contains
    "UsePreviews=False", then import the ConnectionMruList key from SSMS 21's
    privateregistry.bin file to the SSMS 22 one.

.NOTES
    - Requires admin rights.
    - Works only if both SSMS 21 and SSMS 22 are installed side-by-side (aka on the same machine).
    - Backs up the SSMS 22 privateregistry.bin file before making any changes.
